GCC port of the National Volume Estimator Library (NVEL)

This is a fork of the NVEL project using the fortran compiler (gfortran) from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) through MinGW as a build process instead of the Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort). 

This documentation has been written for and tested on 64-bit Windows 10 (home version) and nothing else.

The project consists of the following folder structure:

src
	--BIN
	--BUILD
	--MOD
Makefile
	
SRC is where the source fortran files (.f) are located

BIN is an empty directory where the completed dll will be compiled to

MOD is where module source files are located

Build Steps:

0. You should have MinGW installe (https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php). To check, open a command prompt and run 'gcc --version' to see info on your installed version.

1. Open a command prompt windows and cd into the base directory where the makefile is located(gfortran_build)

2. run 'mingw32-make' this will trigger the build. Compiler output can be output to a text file with the command mingw32-make >CompileReport.txt

Notes:

The compiled functions names will be "mangled" when compiled, so capitalization may have changed and underscores may be added. 
Typically, the names tend to be made lowercase with a leading underscore. E.g. FORTRAN function/subroutine name VERNUM will be mangled to vernum_
